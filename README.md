# Keylogger_detection_tool
A lightweight Python GUI application to help identify potentially suspicious or malicious processes running on your system â€” particularly those that may be indicative of keyloggers or spyware.

## ðŸ›  Features

- Simple and intuitive **Tkinter-based GUI**
- Scans all currently running processes using **psutil**
- Flags suspicious processes based on:
  - Unknown or uncommon executable names
  - Executables running from potentially suspicious directories (`AppData`, `Temp`, `Downloads`, etc.)
- Outputs a detailed report of suspicious findings
- Whitelisting support for known safe processes

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `psutil` library

Install the required dependency using pip:

```bash
pip install psutil
Usage
Run the tool using:

bash
Copy
Edit
python keylogger_detector.py
Once launched:

Click "Start Scan"

The tool will list all suspicious processes not found in the whitelist or running from risky directories.

Review the output to investigate further.

 Sample Output

Scanning running processes...

[!] Suspicious process:
    Name: Code.exe
    Path: C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe

[!] Suspicious process:
    Name: someunknown.exe
    Path: N/A

No suspicious processes found.
Safe Process Whitelist
The following processes are considered safe by default:

explorer.exe

svchost.exe

chrome.exe

firefox.exe

python.exe

notepad.exe

cmd.exe

conhost.exe

System Idle Process

System

You can customize this whitelist by editing the self.safe_processes set inside the Python script.
